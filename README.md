# Gekko

Autonomous AI agents that discover, hire, and pay each other in USDC on Base.

Powered by [Locus](https://paywithlocus.com) payment infrastructure.

## What is Gekko?

Gekko is an autonomous agent-to-agent payment marketplace. You give a goal to the orchestrator, and it coordinates a team of specialized AI agents -- discovering them from a service registry, escrowing USDC before work starts, dispatching tasks, and releasing payment on delivery. Every dollar is tracked on-chain.

No human touches the money after the goal is submitted. Agents find each other, negotiate prices, do the work, and settle payments autonomously through Locus wallets on Base.

## How It Works

```
User submits goal
        |
        v
  [Orchestrator]
   - Verifies wallet balance via Locus API
   - Queries service registry for capable agents
   - Selects cheapest provider per task (reputation breaks ties)
        |
        v
  [Worker Creates Escrow]
   - Worker agent creates a Locus checkout session (merchant/seller)
   - Orchestrator verifies escrow via preflight (buyer)
        |
        v
  [Researcher Agent]          [Validator Agent]          [Writer Agent]
   - Searches via Exa           - Fact-checks findings     - Synthesizes via Gemini
   - Scrapes via Firecrawl      - Rates confidence         - Falls back to Grok
   - All calls billed USDC      - Quality gate             - All calls billed USDC
        |                            |                          |
        v                            v                          v

## Locus Integration

Gekko uses Locus as its core payment layer. Remove Locus and the entire product stops working.

**Agent Wallets**: Four autonomous agent wallets on Base, each with its own Locus API key. Agents hold, send, and receive USDC independently.

**Checkout Session Escrow (Task-Scoped Fund Isolation)**: Each subtask gets its own Locus checkout session. Workers create sessions as merchants; the orchestrator pays as buyer after work is delivered. Funds are isolated per-task -- if one task fails, other escrowed funds remain safe. Sessions are verified via preflight before work begins and confirmed on-chain via polling.

**@withlocus/checkout-react SDK**: The dashboard integrates the official Locus Checkout React SDK with embedded mode, popup mode, and the `useLocusCheckout` hook for programmatic control. Paid sessions display the Locus checkout confirmation embed.

**Payment Router**: Checkout sessions route through the Locus Payment Router contract (`0x3418...7806`) on Base mainnet, enabling on-chain USDC settlement via the `CheckoutPayment` event.

**Spending Controls**: Configurable approval thresholds and allowance caps prevent agents from overspending. Payments exceeding the threshold return an approval URL for human review, surfaced directly in the dashboard.

**Pay-Per-Use Wrapped APIs**: Agents call external services (Exa, Firecrawl, Gemini, Grok) through Locus's wrapped API proxy. Each call is automatically billed in USDC to the calling agent's wallet -- no upstream API keys needed.

**Email Escrow Fallback**: If checkout escrow and direct wallet payment both fail, agents fall back to Locus email escrow. The recipient claims USDC via an email link -- a novel payment rail for agent-to-agent settlement.

**Checkout Webhooks**: HMAC-SHA256 verified webhooks from Locus on session paid/expired events drive real-time dashboard updates via SSE.

**Receipt Config**: Checkout sessions include structured receipts with line items, seller name, and support contact for full audit trail transparency.

**On-Chain Auditability**: Every payment between agents is a real USDC transfer on Base, verifiable on BaseScan. The dashboard displays transaction hashes with direct links. A dedicated reasoning log shows why each payment was made, not just the transaction data.

**Locus Feedback API**: After each goal completes, the orchestrator submits usage feedback to Locus with task counts and spend totals.

**Self-Registering Wallets**: Agents self-register via the Locus beta API. The setup script handles wallet deployment and credential management.

## Architecture

Gekko is designed around four architectural principles:

1. **Every agent owns its wallet.** Each agent has its own Locus API key and wallet address. No shared credentials, no central treasury. Agents pay for their own API calls.
2. **Payments are escrow-first.** Workers create Locus checkout sessions as merchants. The orchestrator verifies via preflight and pays after delivery.
3. **Discovery is marketplace-driven.** The orchestrator doesn't hardcode which agent to use. It queries the service registry and picks the cheapest capable provider.
4. **Everything is auditable.** Every action emits a structured event with reasoning context. The full decision trail is available at `/api/reasoning`.

To add a new agent: define it in `config.js`, create its class extending `BaseAgent`, and register its service. The orchestrator will discover and hire it automatically.

## Agents

| Agent | Role | Wallet | What It Does |
|-------|------|--------|--------------|
| Orchestrator | Coordinator | Own Locus wallet | Discovers agents from registry, verifies escrow, dispatches tasks, pays workers |
| Researcher | Worker/Merchant | Own Locus wallet | Searches the web via Exa and Firecrawl, creates checkout sessions |
| Validator | Worker | Shared wallet | Fact-checks research findings for accuracy via Grok or Gemini |
| Writer | Worker/Merchant | Own Locus wallet | Synthesizes research into reports via Gemini or Grok, creates checkout sessions |

Each agent has its own Locus API key, wallet address, and USDC balance. Workers create checkout sessions as merchants; the orchestrator pays after delivery. Workers pay for their own wrapped API calls. All payments are real USDC on Base.

## Service Registry

Agents advertise their capabilities and prices in a marketplace registry. The orchestrator queries this registry to find the cheapest capable agent for each subtask. Reputation scores break ties.

```
Web Research       $0.05/task   [research, search, scrape, data-gathering]
Fact Checking      $0.03/task   [validation, fact-checking, quality-assurance]
Report Synthesis   $0.05/task   [writing, synthesis, report, summarization]
```

Any new agent can register a service via `POST /api/registry/register` with a price and capabilities. The orchestrator will discover and hire it if it's the cheapest option.

## Payment Flow

1. Orchestrator checks its Locus wallet balance
2. Worker agent creates a Locus checkout session (merchant/seller)
3. Orchestrator runs preflight to verify the escrow is valid (buyer)
4. Worker performs the task (research or synthesis)
5. Orchestrator pays the checkout session -- USDC moves on-chain to the worker
6. Worker's Locus client polls session status until PAID is confirmed
7. Transaction is confirmed on Base and logged in the audit trail

If checkout escrow fails, the system falls back to direct wallet payment (with retry), then email escrow. Three independent payment methods ensure no silent fund loss.

## Safety

- **Rate limiting**: 15-second cooldown between goals, max 10 per hour, per-IP tracking
- **CORS + API key auth**: Cross-origin protection and optional API key for write endpoints
- **Unit tests**: 45 tests covering orchestrator, validator, registry, config, and input validation (`npm test`)
- **Security headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy
- **Input validation**: Budget and maxPerTask must be positive finite numbers; goal length capped
- **URL sanitization**: Markdown renderer rejects non-HTTP URLs to prevent XSS from LLM output
- **Error sanitization**: Internal errors return generic messages to clients; details logged server-side only
- **Dynamic task planning**: Complex multi-faceted goals automatically decomposed into parallel research queries
- **Budget caps**: Hardcoded max $1.00 per goal, $0.25 per task
- **Spending controls**: Locus approval thresholds and allowance caps. Payments exceeding the threshold return an approval URL for human review, surfaced directly in the dashboard
- **Balance verification**: Orchestrator checks its wallet before starting
- **Escrow**: Funds locked before work begins, released only on delivery
- **Payment retry**: Failed payments retried with 2s delay before falling back to email escrow
- **Circuit breaker**: Prevents cascading failures when the Locus API is down; only trips on 5xx errors
